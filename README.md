Implemented features:
  - enemy AI state machine
  - enemy spawn under certain conditions
  - UI with player health and score/gold amount
  - UI in shop scene used to buy skills and health
  - waves and level cotroller
  - data persistance after in scene changing

Use A and D to walk around, W to jump, and Space to attack.
Kill all enemies to finish all waves. 

Enjoy!
